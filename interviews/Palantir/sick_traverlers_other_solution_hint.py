# Input : vector<string> name initial_health_stats cities

# Output: vector<string first line names
# After each line each person's healthy stats
# The last line outputs converge days\

#Use a hashmap to save each city Everyth. There is no pick and recovery. Then traverse and update everyone's state.
# That is, parse input and output are a bit of a hassle. Time is not enough.

# The infection condition is an office in a city, so I Use a map, the key is the city, and the value is the list of names.
# I divide the current situation and the change situation into two parts, so that I will know immediately if I am all healthy at first,
#

ç­‰I will deal with other edge cases in the latter.
# Basically look at the status quo and change the situation, you just write them as they say. At least I don't have time out.
# Pay special attention to the 365th Because there are two kinds of conditions, either full health or not all healthy,
# but they are the last number of 365, and it should be no problem if you pay attention to it.

# I scan every office every day to see If I am sick, and then change the status of each person.

# change the whole thing every time
# healthy, recovering, sick


#sick recovering always changes, healthy when sick
